## About The Project

<p align="center">
  <img width="800" height="480" src="assets/to_readme/eighthly_git.GIF"
</p>

As a good music listener, I know many great music players available, however, few free of any kind of advertisements and streaming subscription to unleash the full power of the player. That's why I decided to create my own player.

Benefits:
* Always listen with maximum quality.
* Be free to skip as many songs as you like at any time!
* Free of advertisements. :smile:

The project is currently in a demo version. Feel free to come back and follow the news.
